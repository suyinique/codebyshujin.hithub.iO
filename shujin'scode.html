        <div class="message" id="message1">yo, harou! time flies so fast, and today is friday. haloy na kitang dai nagkakaulay, I learned that phrase from a bicolana friend. ion know why I totally agree with this and i'm surprised I haven't flirted with anyone in almost a year. my last flirt was with you in January, and I never talked to anyone after that. I want to be upfront with you - ion have feelings for you rn, but I want to try again because we might work this time. gusto ko rin mag kita us this year, despite our past and the hurt we've caused each other. if we don't work out this time, I'll never give us another chance. this is our last shot, and I'm serious about it.</div>
        <div class="message" id="message2">as I'll be starting college soon, I don't want a chaotic life. I want to see that you've changed, not just for me but for yourself 2. I want you to be honest with me and not be shy about sharing your thoughts. opkors, I will do that 2 sa'yo, para nmn fair lang. let's leave everything in the past and start fresh. even though I hold unfavorable views about you, I trust you and your words. I'm only doing this with you because I want my end game to be you. yes, oo, ikaw, to you, sa'yo.</div>
        <div class="message" id="message3">a girl tried to hook up with me yesterday (she knew me because sa cof nmn here sa imus nina sam and ash), but I declined because we're talking, and I think you're my suitor too?? I'm not sure, and ion want to be delulu. let's communicate openly, especially about negative thoughts ha. if you don't make an effort, don't expect me to keep chatting with you. I might disappear and never respond again, but I do not want that to happen. I'm trying to like you again, and I'm rooting for us to talk more. if things don't change next month, I'm not sure what will happen, especially since we're far apart. nevertheless, I'll do my best to make you feel like I'm deserving and worth it. that's all, and good luck with your acads. remember, whether you're my end game or not, I'll always be proud of you.</div>
